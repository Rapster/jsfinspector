                    A library to make life of JSF developers a bit easier. Ever wondered whats in the component tree or why a 
                    component doesn't show up? JSFInspector helps to investigate the issue. JSFInspector is used during development 
                    time. It comes as handy JAR file, no special IDE or plugin required.

                <h2>How many components are there?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    Since JSF is a stateful serverside component framework, size of the component tree matters. 
                    The more components on a view, the more time is spent on instantiation, validation and rendering. 
                    Do you know how many components are on every view of your application and whats the impact on performance?
                    JSFInspector helps to find out.

                <h2>Where are my components?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    JSFInspector gives you a list of all components in the current view. Those you declared in XHTML / JSP, 
                    those you added programmatically, those that were created by the framework or a library. And those that you forgot 
                    where and why you added them. Hovering a components clientId in JSFInspectors component view highlights its visual 
                    output, making it easy to find them in complex layouts (as long as the component was rendered).                </div>

                    JSFInspector creates an overview of the lifecycle phases. The overview features the duration and status of each lifecycle phase. 
                    It offers an easy way to find out which phase was completed or if validation did fail. It is especially useful to find bugs related to the 
                    immediate attribute in views with complex component structures.

                    JSFInspector comes as a JAR that simply needs to be placed in your applications classpath. No further configuration is needed.
                    Once the JAR is available in your application, the inspector component can be used by declaring the JSFInspector namespace. 
                    The inspector component may be placed anaywhere in a facelet or template:
                    <pre>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
      xmlns:i="http://thomas-asel.de/jsfinspector"&gt;

            ...

            &lt;i:inspector /&gt;
            
            ...

&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section right">
                <h2>Usage</h2>
                <p>
                JSFInspector is displayed as a unobtrusive clickable panel on the ipper left corner of the screen. This ist to ensure that the existing layout is
                not affected when JSInspector is used an every page (e.g. by defining it in a template). JSFInspector is only displayed if JSF is running in

                This is what JSFInspector looks like in a typical scenario:
